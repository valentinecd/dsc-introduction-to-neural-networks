    "Neural networks are becoming increasingly more popular and are responsible for some of the most cutting edge advancements in data science including image and speech recognition. They have also been transformative in reducing the need for intensive and often time intensive feature engineering needed for traditional supervised learning tasks. In this lesson, we'll investigate the architecture of neural networks.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's start with an easy example to get an idea of what a neural network is. Imagine a city has 10 ice cream vendors. We would like to predict what the sales amount is for an ice cream vendor given certain input features. Let's say you have several features to predict the sales for each ice cream vendor: the location, the way the ice cream is priced, and the variety in the ice cream offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the input feature *location*. You know that one of the things that really affects the sales is how many people will walk by the ice cream shop, as these are all potential customers. And realistically, the volume of people passing is largely driven by the *location*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's look at the input feature *pricing*. How the ice cream is priced really tells us something about the affordability, which will affect sales as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Last, let's look at the *variety in offering*. When an ice cream shop offers a lot of different ice cream flavors, this might be perceived as a higher quality shop just because customers have more flavors to choose from (and might really like that!). On the other hand, *pricing* might also affect perceived quality: customers might feel that the quality is higher if the prices are higher. This shows that several inputs might affect one hidden feature, as these features in the so-called \"hidden layer\" are called. \n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, all features will be connected with all nodes in the hidden layer, and weights will be assigned to the edges (more about this later), as you can see in the network below. That's why networks like this are also referred to as **densely connected neural networks**. \n",

That's why this layer is called the **hidden layer**, with the nodes representing **hidden units**.  \n",
